Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-is all about writing instructions for computers and building apps, games, and websites that make our lives easier.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The birth of software engineering was in 1968 in NATO conference that was supposed to address the software crisis
-The introducction of object oriented program with languages like c++ and later java
-Rise of Agile Methodologies marked a shift from traditional waterfall models to iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-planning;this phase ensures proper resource allocation and timeline estimation
-requirement; this phase helps in defining what the software should achieve
-design; this phase  sets the foundation for coding by providing blueprints
-implementation; this is the actual phase where developers write codes based on designs specifications
-testing;identifying and fixing bugs
-deployment;release of the software either full or in baches
-maintainance and support; fixing issues, providing updates and improving software based user feedback

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-waterfall is a sequential and linear approach to saftware developement where each phase is done before moving to the next for example a hospital management system.
-Agile is the flexible approach to software development that emphasizes adaptability,customer feedback and continuous feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-software developer; writes and maintain codes based of the software
-quality assuarance engineer;ensure codes is bug free and meets starndards
-project manager;oversees the entire software development and ensures project succes

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs provides a comprehensive  workspace for coding debugging and testing applications i.e vscode, Eclipse
-VCS allows collabration, history tracking, branch and merging and backup and recovery i.e git and mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-debugging and fixing bugs; using debugging tools like IDEs like VScode
-managing project complexity; breaking codes into managable sizes
-keeeping up with rapidly changing technologies; join developers community either in github

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-unit testing; test individual components or function of the code in isolation, it detects bugs early and improve code quality.
-intergration testing; test how different modules or components work together,it prevents system failure
-system testing; test the entire software sytem as a whole, ensures the system works as expected before release.
-acceptance testing;test whether software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- is the process of dsigning and optimizing input prompts to guide models in generating accurate, relevant,and useful responses
- it enhance AI accuracy, it improves its efficiency, it optimizes AI performance

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
